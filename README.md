# crowbar-investigator-experiments
Scripts &amp; data from counterexample size experiments for the crowbar investigator.

This repo contains 300 [ABS](https://abs-models.org) programs randomly generated with [MockABS](https://github.com/rec0de/mockABS) and their associated counterexamples generated by the [crowbar](https://github.com/edkamb/crowbar-tool) investigator.
The scripts and plots included here are part of my bachelor's thesis on Counterexample Generation for Formal Verification of ABS.
